  abstract = {One of the oldest challenges in ecology is to understand the processes that underpin the composition of communities. Historically, an obvious way in which to describe community compositions has been diversity in terms of the number and abundances of species. However, the failure to reject contradictory models has led to communities now being characterized by trait and phylogenetic diversities. Our objective here is to demonstrate how species, trait and phylogenetic diversity can be combined together from large to local spatial scales to reveal the historical, deterministic and stochastic processes that impact the compositions of local communities. Research in this area has recently been advanced by the development of mathematical measures that incorporate trait dissimilarities and phylogenetic relatedness between species. However, measures of trait diversity have been developed independently of phylogenetic measures and conversely most of the phylogenetic diversity measures have been developed independently of trait diversity measures. This has led to semantic confusions particularly when classical ecological and evolutionary approaches are integrated so closely together. Consequently, we propose a unified semantic framework and demonstrate the importance of the links among species, phylogenetic and trait diversity indices. Furthermore, species, trait and phylogenetic diversity indices differ in the ways they can be used across different spatial scales. The connections between large-scale, regional and local processes allow the consideration of historical factors in addition to local ecological deterministic or stochastic processes. Phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used in large-scale analyses to determine how historical and/or environmental factors affect both the formation of species assemblages and patterns in species richness across latitude or elevation gradients. Both phylogenetic and trait diversity have been used at different spatial scales to identify the relative impacts of ecological deterministic processes such as environmental filtering and limiting similarity from alternative processes such as random speciation and extinction, random dispersal and ecological drift. Measures of phylogenetic diversity combine phenotypic and genetic diversity and have the potential to reveal both the ecological and historical factors that impact local communities. Consequently, we demonstrate that, when used in a comparative way, species, trait and phylogenetic structures have the potential to reveal essential details that might act simultaneously in the assembly of species communities. We highlight potential directions for future research. These might include how variation in trait and phylogenetic diversity alters with spatial distances, the role of trait and phylogenetic diversity in global-scale gradients, the connections between traits and phylogeny, the importance of trait rarity and independent evolutionary history in community assembly, the loss of trait and phylogenetic diversity due to human impacts, and the mathematical developments of biodiversity indices including within-species variations.},

There is a growing consensus, however, that functional diversity, or the value and range of species traits, rather than species numbers per se, strongly determines ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, and the fact that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate, functional diversity has been studied in relatively few cases. Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the functional diversity in ecological communities is very promising for both studying the response of diversity to environmental gradients and the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (i.e. in {"}biodiversity experiments{"}). In our view, the Rao coefficient is a good candidate for an efficient functional diversity index. It is, in fact, a generalization of the Simpson's index of diversity and it can be used with various measures of dissimilarity between species (both those based on a single trait and those based on several traits). However, when intending to quantify the functional diversity, we have to make various methodological decisions such as how many and which traits to use, how to weight them, how to combine traits that are measured at different scales and how to quantify the species' relative abundances in a community. Here we discuss these issues with examples from real plant communities and argue that diversity within a single trait is often the most ecologically relevant information. When using indices based on many traits, we plead for careful a priori selection of ecologically relevant traits, although other options are also feasible. When combining many traits, often with different scales, methods considering the extent of species overlap in trait space can be applied for both the qualitative and quantitative traits. Another possibility proposed here is to decompose the variability of a trait in a community according to the relative effect of among- and within-species differentiation (with the latter not considered by current indices of functional diversity), in a way analogical to decomposition of Sum of squares in ANOVA. Further, we show why the functional diversity is more tightly related to species diversity (measured by Simpson index) when biomass is used as a measure of population abundance, in comparison with frequency. Finally, the general expectation is that functional diversity can be a better predictor of ecosystem functioning than the number of species or the number of functional groups. However, we demonstrate that some of the expectations might be overrated - in particular, the {"}sampling effect{"} in biodiversity experiments is not avoided when functional diversity is used as a predictor.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3.\hspace{0.6em}In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5.\hspace{0.6em}Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

Macroecology is part of this â€œBig Dataâ€ trend, with a strong rise in the volume of data that we are using for our research. Here, we summarize the most recent developments in macroecology in the age of Big Data that were presented at the 2018 annual meeting of the Specialist Group Macroecology of the Ecological Society of Germany, Austria and Switzerland (GfÃ–). Supported by computational advances, macroecology has been a rapidly developing field over recent years. Our meeting highlighted important avenues for further progress in terms of standardized data collection, data integration, method development and process integration. In particular, we focus on (a) important data gaps and new initiatives to close them, for example through space- and airborne sensors, (b) how various data sources and types can be integrated, (c) how uncertainty can be assessed in data-driven analyses and (d) how Big Data and machine learning approaches have opened new ways of investigating processes rather than simply describing patterns. We discuss how Big Data opens up new opportunities, but also poses new challenges to macroecological research. In the future, it will be essential to carefully assess data quality, the reproducibility of data compilation and analytical methods, and the communication of uncertainties. Major progress in the field will depend on the definition of data standards and workflows for macroecology, such that scientific quality and integrity are guaranteed, and collaboration in research projects is made easier.},

  abstract = {Functional richness, currently defined as the amount of niche space occupied by the species within a community, is one of the three major components of functional diversity. Different indices have been developed in order to quantify this component. However, the range of indices available for assessing functional richness, often mathematically complex and based on different rationales, can cause confusion for field ecologists and lead to misinterpretation of the results obtained. In this context, we have provided the first study exclusively focused on the comparison of the definitions, advantages and drawbacks of a large set of functional richness indices. The first part of this work is focused on four indices (FDP\&G, FRic, TOP and N-hypervolumes indices) that are currently the most commonly used for assessing functional richness. We have completed our study by including recently developed indices that enable us to take into account the intraspecific trait variability (i.e. FRim index and TDP framework), because there is currently a growing scientific consensus regarding the necessity of including this aspect in the assessment of the functional diversity of communities. We demonstrate that although authors have argued that their index describes the functional richness, each of them describes only part of it, and this part may strongly differ from one index to another. Rather than advocating the general use of a single index and/or systematically avoiding others, our study highlights the need for selecting indices in close relation with the context, the available data and the aims of each study. Such a strategy is an essential preliminary step for preventing misunderstanding and artefactual controversies. Along these lines, we propose some guidelines to help users in selecting the most appropriate indices according both to the facet of functional richness on which they wish to focus and to the characteristics of the available data.},

  abstract = {Question Which functional diversity indices have the power to reveal changes in community assembly processes along abiotic stress gradients? Is their power affected by stochastic processes and variations in species richness along stress gradients? Methods We used a simple community assembly model to explore the power of functional diversity indices across a wide range of ecological contexts. The model assumes that with declining stress the influence of niche complementarity on species fitness increases while that of environmental filtering decreases. We separately incorporated two trait-independent stochastic processes â€“ mass and priority effects â€“ in simulating species occurrences and abundances along a hypothetical stress gradient. We ran simulations where species richness was constant along the gradient, or increased, decreased or varied randomly with declining stress. We compared observed values for two indices of functional richness â€“ total functional dendrogram length (FD) and convex hull volume (FRic) â€“ with a matrix-swap null model (yielding indices SESFD and SESFRic) to remove any trivial effects of species richness. We also compared two indices that measure both functional richness and functional divergence â€“ Rao quadratic entropy (Rao) and functional dispersion (FDis) â€“ with a null model that randomizes abundances across species but within communities. This converts them to pure measures of functional divergence (SESRao and SESFDis). Results When mass effects operated, only SESRao and SESFDis gave reasonable power, irrespective of how species richness varied along the stress gradient. FD, FRic, Rao and FDis had low power when species richness was constant, and variation in species richness greatly influenced their power. SESFRic and SESFD were unaffected by variation in species richness. When priority effects operated, FRic, SESFRic, Rao and FDis had good power and were unaffected by variation in species richness. Variation in species richness greatly affected FD and SESFD. SESRao and SESFDis had low power in the priority effects model but were unaffected by variation in species richness. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that a reliable test for changes in assembly processes along stress gradients requires functional diversity indices measuring either functional richness or functional divergence. We recommend using SESFRic as a measure of functional richness and either SESRao or SESFDis (which are very closely related mathematically) as a measure of functional divergence. Used together, these indices of functional richness and functional divergence provide good power to test for increasing niche complementarity with declining stress across a broad range of ecological contexts.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is the diversity of species traits in ecosystems. This concept is increasingly used in ecological research, yet its formal definition and measurements are currently under discussion. As the overall behavior and consistency of functional diversity indices have not been described so far, the novice user risks choosing an inaccurate index or a set of redundant indices to represent functional diversity. In our study we closely examine functional diversity indices to clarify their accuracy, consistency, and independence. Following current theory, we categorize them into functional richness, evenness, or divergence indices. We considered existing indices as well as new indices developed in this study. The new indices aimed at remedying the weaknesses of currently used indices (e.g., by taking into account intraspecific variability). Using virtual data sets, we test (1) whether indices respond to community changes as expected from their category and (2) whether the indices within each category are consistent and independent of indices from other categories. We also test the accuracy of methods proposed for the use of categorical traits. Most classical functional richness indices either failed to describe functional richness or were correlated with functional divergence indices. We therefore recommend using the new functional richness indices that consider intraspecific variability and thus empty space in the functional niche space. In contrast, most functional evenness and divergence indices performed well with respect to all proposed tests. For categorical variables, we do not recommend blending discrete and real-valued traits (except for indices based on distance measures) since functional evenness and divergence have no transposable meaning for discrete traits. Nonetheless, species diversity indices can be applied to categorical traits (using trait levels instead of species) in order to describe functional richness and equitability.},

  abstract = {Many indices have been proposed to measure functional diversity and its four distinct dimensions: functional richness, evenness, divergence and redundancy. Identifying indices that reliably measure the functional diversity dimension(s) of interest requires careful testing of how each index responds to species' traits and abundance distributions. In the absence of a convenient simulation tool, tests with artificial data have to date explored only a limited number of scenarios or have altered trait and abundance distributions only indirectly based on principles of evolution and community assembly. We provide simul.comms, an R function that allows users to test the efficacy of functional diversity indices by easily creating artificial species communities with user-specified abundance and trait distributions for continuous, ordinal and categorical traits. To illustrate the function's utility, we examine the performance of R, a recently published abundance-sensitive index for functional redundancy. We use two approaches to designing simulation tests for this example analysis. The first uses simul.comms to create six separate sets of artificial communities to qualitatively assess how R responds to predictable changes in functional redundancy. The second uses simul.comms to independently alter seven community composition parameters, whose influence on R is then examined quantitatively via effect sizes in linear regression. Our analyses indicate that R broadly mirrors expected changes in functional redundancy and predictably responds to changes in community composition parameters. R appears, however, to primarily reflect trait distributions, responding minimally to variance in abundance and counter-intuitively to abundance range. Further refinement of tools to measure functional redundancy may therefore be desirable. The R tool we provide should assist with refining functional diversity measures, a critical step towards improving our ability to understand and mitigate the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. Because simul.comms simply produces two linked matrices, a species-by-traits matrix and a site-by-species abundance matrix, it may be equally valuable in exploring questions and analytical approaches in other areas of community ecology.},

  abstract = {Community assembly theory suggests that two processes affect the distribution of trait values within communities: competition and habitat filtering. Within a local community, competition leads to ecological differentiation of coexisting species, while habitat filtering reduces the spread of trait values, reflecting shared ecological tolerances. Many statistical tests for the effects of competition exist in the literature, but measures of habitat filtering are less well-developed. Here, we present convex hull volume, a construct from computational geometry, which provides an n-dimensional measure of the volume of trait space occupied by species in a community. Combined with ecological null models, this measure offers a useful test for habitat filtering. We use convex hull volume and a null model to analyze California woody-plant trait and community data. Our results show that observed plant communities occupy less trait space than expected from random assembly, a result consistent with habitat filtering.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

To do so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were mostly early-career scientists who studied biology as undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of quantitative training: 75\% were not satisfied with their understanding of mathematical models; 75\% felt that the level of mathematics was â€œtoo lowâ€ in their ecology classes; 90\% wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95\% more statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30\% of classes in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing programs. The main suggestion to improve quantitative training was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will require dedicated, quantitative classes for ecology-related degrees that contain good mathematical and statistical practice.},

It is therefore important to simultaneously study the impacts of global warming on interdependent taxa from different trophic levels. Here, we quantify current and potential future associations of functional diversity (based on multiple traits) and functional identity (based on individual traits) between interacting taxa using projection models under climate change. Location: A tropical elevational gradient (500\textendash 3500 m a.s.l.) in the Man\'u biosphere reserve, southeast Peru Methods: We investigated different scenarios of how species' elevational ranges might change under climate change based on projected future increases in mean annual temperature and current associations of species' elevational ranges with temperature. We computed the functional diversity and identity of current and potential future plant and bird communities based on morphological traits that influence plant-frugivore interactions. Finally, we tested for changes in the associations between projected functional diversity and identity of future plant and bird communities. Results: Projected functional diversity of plants and birds decreased under range contraction and range shift scenarios at low elevations. At mid and high elevations, functional diversity of both species groups increased most strongly under range expansion. Correspondence between plant and bird functional diversity was weakest under range contraction, while it remained strong under range expansion and shift. Similarly, the correspondence of projected plant and bird functional identity was weakest under a range contraction scenario. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that a scenario in which species are dispersal-limited and sensitive to increasing temperatures is likely to cause a functional mismatch between plant and bird communities along this tropical elevational gradient. This implies that certain functional types of plants could miss avian seed dispersers in the future. Our approach of studying functional diversity of interacting taxa could be more widely applied to identify potential future mismatches between trophic levels.},

Most of the indices that measure diversity depend on variables that have various statistical types (e.g. circular, fuzzy, ordinal) and that go through a matrix of distances among species. We show how to compute such distances from a generalization of Gower's distance, which is dedicated to the treatment of mixed data. We prove Gower's distance can be extended to include new types of data. The impact of this generalization is illustrated on a real data set containing 80 plant species and 13 various traits. Gower's distance allows an efficient treatment of missing data and the inclusion of variable weights. An evaluation of the real contribution of each variable to the mixed distance is proposed. We conclude that such a generalized index will be crucial for analyzing functional diversity at small and large scales.},

Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed. However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces. Innovation Here we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a functional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assemblages, using simulated datasets and a real study case. Main conclusions The quality of functional space strongly varied between situations. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while functional dendrograms and two-dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor-quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore, we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.},

This framework can be applied to three facets of biodiversity: taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. These three facets of biodiversity can be expressed as Hill numbers with the same units (effective number of species), facilitating direct comparisons between them (Chao et al., 2014). In addition, this framework can account for species abundance by changing the parameter q, which can be any non-negative number (e.g., 0, 0.99, 2). As q increases, the diversity values become more sensitive to common species. When q = 0, species abundance is ignored; q = 1, all species are weighted by their abundance equally (i.e., Shannon's diversity for taxonomic diversity); q = 2, common species get more weight than rare species (i.e., inverse of Simpson diversity for taxonomic diversity). Furthermore, both alpha and beta diversity can be calculated with this framework. Given the above advantages, this framework has been adopted by an increasing number of researchers.},

The analysis of long-term and high-frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student training programs in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacy?that is, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasks?is rarely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experience developing undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysis and simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives, Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) and Macrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R) and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The use of prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increase students? experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. These types of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with the computational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses on their own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand the availability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers in data science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science in ecology.},

  abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence\textendash absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ``FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

Location Europe, 25 large river basins. Methods Here, we develop a decomposition of functional {$\beta$}-diversity, i.e. the dissimilarity in functional composition between communities, into a functional turnover and a functional nestedness-resultant component. Results We found that functional {$\beta$}-diversity was lower than taxonomic {$\beta$}-diversity. This difference was driven by a lower functional turnover compared with taxonomic turnover while the nestedness-resultant component was similar for taxonomic and functional {$\beta$}-diversity. Main conclusions Fish faunas with different species tend to share the same functional attributes. The framework presented in this paper will help to analyse biogeographical patterns as well as to measure the impact of human activities on the functional facets of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {R is an open-source programming environment for statistical computing and graphics structured by numerous contributed packages. The current packages used for biodiversity research focus on limited, particular aspects of biodiversity. Most packages focus on the number and abundance of species. I present an r package named adiv that provides additional methods to measure and analyse biodiversity. adiv contains approaches to quantify species-based, trait-based (functional) and phylogenetic diversity (a) within communities ({$\alpha$} diversity), (b) between communities ({$\beta$} diversity) and (c) to partition it over space and time ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} levels of diversity). Partitioning approaches allow evaluating whether the levels of {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity could have been obtained by chance. Moreover, groups of biological entities (e.g. species of the same clade or with similar biological characteristics) that drive each level of diversity ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$}) can be identified via ordination analyses. Although the package focuses on interspecific diversity in its current state, the developed approaches can also be applied to analyse intraspecific diversity or, at another level, ecosystem diversity. More generally, the functions can be applied in any discipline interested in the concept of diversity, such as economics or linguistics. Indeed, all available approaches can be easily applied at other scales and to other disciplines provided that the data have the required format: a matrix of abundance or presence/absence data of some entities in some collections and information on the differences between the entities. adiv aims to complement existing r packages to provide scientists with a wide variety of diversity indices, as each index reflects a very specific facet of biodiversity. adiv will grow in the future to integrate as many validated approaches for biodiversity analysis as possible, not yet available in r. As it includes both traditional and recent viewpoints on how biodiversity should be evaluated, adiv offers a promising platform where methods to analyse biodiversity can be developed and compared in terms of their statistical behaviour and biological relevance. Applications of the most relevant tools for a given study aim will eventually improve research on human-driven variations in biodiversity.},

  abstract = {A unified framework to calculate biodiversity of ecological communities through Hill numbers (Hill, 1973; Jost, 2006) was recently proposed by Chao, Chiu, \& Jost (2014). This framework can be applied to three facets of biodiversity: taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. These three facets of biodiversity can be expressed as Hill numbers with the same units (effective number of species), facilitating direct comparisons between them (Chao et al., 2014). In addition, this framework can account for species abundance by changing the parameter q, which can be any non-negative number (e.g., 0, 0.99, 2). As q increases, the diversity values become more sensitive to common species. When q = 0, species abundance is ignored; q = 1, all species are weighted by their abundance equally (i.e., Shannon's diversity for taxonomic diversity); q = 2, common species get more weight than rare species (i.e., inverse of Simpson diversity for taxonomic diversity). Furthermore, both alpha and beta diversity can be calculated with this framework. Given the above advantages, this framework has been adopted by an increasing number of researchers.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity (FD), the diversity of organism attributes that relates to their interactions with the abiotic and biotic environment, has been increasingly used for the last two decades in ecology, biogeography and conservation. Yet, FD has many facets and their estimations are not standardized nor embedded in a single tool. mFD (multifaceted functional diversity) is an R package that uses matrices of species assemblages and species trait values as building blocks to compute most FD indices. mFD is firstly based on two functions allowing the user to summarize trait and assemblage data. Then it calculates trait-based distances between species pairs, informs the user whether species have to be clustered into functional entities and finally computes multidimensional functional space. To let the user choose the most appropriate functional space for computing multidimensional functional diversity indices, two mFD functions allow assessing and illustrating the quality of each functional space. Next, mFD provides 6 core functions to calculate 16 existing FD indices based on trait-based distances, functional entities or species position in a functional space. The mFD package also provides graphical functions based on the ggplot library to illustrate FD values through customizable and high-resolution plots of species distribution among functional entities or in a multidimensional space. All functions include internal validation processes to check for errors in data formatting which return detailed error messages. To facilitate the use of mFD framework, we built an associated website hosting five tutorials illustrating the use of all the functions step by step.},
