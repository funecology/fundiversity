This vignette presents some performance tests ran between `fundiversity` and other functional diversity packages. Note that to avoid the dependency on other packages, this vignette is **pre-computed**.

# Other functions/packages to compute functional diversity indices

**`FD::dbFD()`** is probably the most known function to compute functional diversity indices. It comes from the `FD` package proposed by Laliberté and Legendre [-@Laliberte_FD_2014]. It can compute many indices: functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, community-weighted mean, functional divergence, functional dispersion, and functional group richness. This swiss-army knife of functional diversity indices has many options and compute several indices in a single run.

**`hillR::hill_func()`** comes from the `hillR` package that computes Hill numbers for taxonomic, functional, and functional diversity [@Li_hillR_2018]. It implements indices proposed by Chao and colleagues [-@Chao_Unifying_2014]. It computes Rao's quadratic entropy, the mean functional diversity per species, as well as the total functional diversity.

**`adiv::QE()`** comes from the `adiv` package which proposes a toolkit to analyze biodiversity [@Pavoine_adiv_2020]. This function computes Rao's quadratic entropy.

**`SYNCSA::rao.diversity()`** comes from `SYNCSA` package which proposes a simulation framework for meta-communities [@Debastiani_SYNCSA_2012]. The function computes Rao's quadratic entropy as well as functional redundancy.

# Benchmark

We will now benchmark the functions included in `fundiversity` with the corresponding function in other packages using the `microbenchmark::microbenchmark()` function.

```{r setup}
tictoc::tic()
library(fundiversity)
data("traits_birds", package = "fundiversity")
data("site_sp_birds", package = "fundiversity")

dist_traits_birds <- dist(traits_birds)
```

With the fairly small (~220 species, 8 sites, 4 traits) provided dataset in `fundiversity`:

```{r bench-data-rao}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  fundiversity = {
    fundiversity::fd_raoq(traits = NULL, site_sp_birds, dist_traits_birds)
  },
  adiv = {
    adiv::QE(site_sp_birds, dis = dist_traits_birds)
  },
  hillR = {
    hillR::hill_func(site_sp_birds, dist_traits_birds, traits_as_is = TRUE)[1, ]
  },
  SYNCSA = {
    SYNCSA::rao.diversity(site_sp_birds,
                          phylodist = as.matrix(dist_traits_birds),
                          standardize = FALSE)$PhyRao
  },
  FD = {
    suppressMessages(
      FD::dbFD(x = dist_traits_birds, a = site_sp_birds, stand.x = FALSE,
               calc.FRic = TRUE, calc.CWM = FALSE, calc.FDiv = FALSE,
               calc.FGR = FALSE, m = "max", stand.FRic = FALSE))
  },
  times = 200
)
```


## Increasing the number of species

```{r bench-species-data}
make_more_sp <- function(n) {
  traits <- do.call(rbind, replicate(n, traits_birds, simplify = FALSE))
  row.names(traits) <- paste0("sp", seq_len(nrow(traits)))

  site_sp <- do.call(cbind, replicate(n, site_sp_birds, simplify = FALSE))
  colnames(site_sp) <- paste0("sp", seq_len(ncol(site_sp)))

  list(tr = traits, si = site_sp)
}

null_sp_1000   <- make_more_sp(5)
null_sp_10000  <- make_more_sp(50)
null_sp_100000 <- make_more_sp(500)
```

```{r bench-species-fric}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  species_200    = fd_fric(     traits_birds, site_sp_birds),
  species_1000   = fd_fric(  null_sp_1000$tr, null_sp_1000$si),
  species_10000  = fd_fric( null_sp_10000$tr, null_sp_10000$si),
  species_100000 = fd_fric(null_sp_100000$tr, null_sp_100000$si),
  times = 100
)
```

```{r bench-species-fdiv}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  species_200    = fd_fdiv(     traits_birds, site_sp_birds),
  species_1000   = fd_fdiv(  null_sp_1000$tr, null_sp_1000$si),
  species_10000  = fd_fdiv( null_sp_10000$tr, null_sp_10000$si),
  species_100000 = fd_fdiv(null_sp_100000$tr, null_sp_100000$si),
  times = 100
)
```

```{r bench-species-raoq}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  species_200    = fd_raoq(     traits_birds, site_sp_birds),
  species_1000   = fd_raoq(  null_sp_1000$tr, null_sp_1000$si),
  species_10000  = fd_raoq( null_sp_10000$tr, null_sp_10000$si),
  times = 100
)
```

## Increasing the number of sites

```{r bench-sites-data}
make_more_sites <- function(n) {
  site_sp <- do.call(rbind, replicate(n, site_sp_birds, simplify = FALSE))
  rownames(site_sp) <- paste0("s", seq_len(nrow(site_sp)))

  site_sp
}

site_sp_100   <- make_more_sites(12)
site_sp_1000  <- make_more_sites(120)
site_sp_10000 <- make_more_sites(1200)
```

```{r bench-sites-fric}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  sites_10    = fd_fric(traits_birds, site_sp_birds),
  sites_100   = fd_fric(traits_birds, site_sp_100),
  sites_1000  = fd_fric(traits_birds, site_sp_1000),
  sites_10000 = fd_fric(traits_birds, site_sp_10000),
  times = 100
)

```

```{r bench-sites-fdiv}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  sites_10    = fd_fdiv(traits_birds, site_sp_birds),
  sites_100   = fd_fdiv(traits_birds, site_sp_100),
  sites_1000  = fd_fdiv(traits_birds, site_sp_1000),
  sites_10000 = fd_fdiv(traits_birds, site_sp_10000),
  times = 100
)
```

```{r bench-sites-raoq}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  sites_10    = fd_raoq(traits = NULL, site_sp_birds, dist_traits_birds),
  sites_100   = fd_raoq(traits = NULL, site_sp_100,   dist_traits_birds),
  sites_1000  = fd_raoq(traits = NULL, site_sp_1000,  dist_traits_birds),
  sites_10000 = fd_raoq(traits = NULL, site_sp_10000, dist_traits_birds),
  times = 100
)
