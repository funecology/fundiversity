\title{Compute Functional Richness (FRic)}
\usage{
fd_fric(traits, sp_com, stand = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{traits}{Trait matrix with species as rows and traits as columns.
It has to contain exclusively numerical values. This can be
either a \code{matrix}, a \code{data.frame}, or a \code{\link[Matrix:Matrix]{Matrix::Matrix()}}
object.}

\item{sp_com}{Site-species matrix with sites as rows and species as columns
if not provided, the function considers all species with equal
abundance in a single site. This can be either a \code{matrix},
a \code{data.frame}, or a \code{\link[Matrix:Matrix]{Matrix::Matrix()}} object.}

\item{stand}{a boolean indicating whether to standardize FRic values over
the observed maximum over all species (default: \code{FALSE}).
This scales FRic between 0 and 1.
\strong{NB}: The maximum FRic values only considers species that are
present in \strong{both} site-species and trait matrices.
If you want to consider species that are absent
in the site-species matrix, add corresponding columns of 0s.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{site} the names of the sites as the row names of the input \code{sp_com},
\item \code{FRic} the values of functional richness at each site.
}

If the \code{sp_com} argument is not provided or if \code{sp_com} doesn't have rownames,
arbitrary rownames \code{s1}, \code{s2}, \code{s3}, etc. will be used.

NB: FRic is equal to \code{NA} when there are strictly less species in a site
than the number of provided traits. Note that only species with strictly
different trait combinations are considered unique, species that share the
exact same trait values across all traits are considered as one species.
}
\description{
Functional Richness is computed as the volume of the convex hull from all
included traits following Villéger et al. (2008).
NB: FRic is equal to \code{NA} when there are strictly less species in a site
than the number of provided traits.
}
\details{
By default, when loading \pkg{fundiversity}, the functions to
compute convex hulls are
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization}{memoised} through the \code{memoise}
package if it is installed (their results are cached to avoid recomputing the
same functional volume twice). To deactivate this behavior you can set the
option \code{fundiversity.memoise} to \code{FALSE} by running the following line:
\code{options(fundiversity.memoise = FALSE)}. If you use it interactively it will
only affect your current session. Add it to your script(s) or \code{.Rprofile}
file to avoid toggling it each time. By changing the option, the behavior
will automatically change the next time you run the function. \strong{Note}:
memoisation is only available when the \code{memoise} package has been installed
\strong{and without parallelization}, otherwise \code{fundiversity} will use unmemoised
versions of the functions.
}
\section{Parallelization}{

The computation of this function can be parallelized thanks to
\code{\link[future:plan]{future::plan()}}. To get more information on how to parallelize your
computation please refer to the parallelization vignette with:
\code{vignette("fundiversity_1-parallel", package = "fundiversity")}
